liribot (updated)

<h1> Liribot</h1>

<p> A take on how siri would be if bootcamp had it's shot. Make sure to download the npm packages in order for it to run on the terminal!</p>

<p><ul> Node packages used were:
    <li> twitter</li>
    <li> spotify</li>
     <li> OMBD</li>
     <li> Just to name a few</li>
    
go ahead and try it out.</p>

<p>NOTE: all this is used only on the terminal, still nothing showing up on the front end of the things</p>
